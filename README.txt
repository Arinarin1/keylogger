Once placing this file into a python project, you'll need to create a text file called "log.txt", or a name of your choosing, to store keystrokes in.

Feel free to make changes and break things!

Some uses of a keylogger include:

    - Business Administration: Monitor what employees are doing.
    - School/Institutions: Track keystrokes and log banned words in a file.
    - Personal Control and File Backup: Make sure no one is using your computer when you are away.
    - Parental Control: Track what your children are doing.
    - Self analysis

Feel free to contribute to fix any problems, and comment any issues (:
